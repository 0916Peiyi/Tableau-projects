# Tableau-projects
It's a tableau dashboard of Unicef

This dashboard shows some findings from UNICEF data of world demographics, 
and the dashboard will focus on Africaâ€™s demographics such as growth rates, fertility rate and life expectancy, in order to determine some relationships between them.
Audiences: I want to appeal to relevant government departments and fertility organizations that --- Attention needs to be paid to African women.

Please click the 'FINAL_DASHBOARD.pdf' to access the whole final dashboard!!!

Details:
We can found from these four number and the maps that Africa's population growth rate is much higher than the global population growth rate, but life expectancy is 15 years lower than the world average.

Then we can find some details from the chart below: 
(1)Four of the top eight female fertility in the world are in Africa and are all ranked high, which is why the population growth rate in Africa is high; 
(2)The average life expectancy in Africa is the shortest in different regions over different time periods, although life expectancy rises slightly over time.
(3)Finally, we can find that as women's fertility increases, their life expectancy is getting shorter. This may also be the cause of the problem we found at the beginning
